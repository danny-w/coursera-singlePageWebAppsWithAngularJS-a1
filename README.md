Coursera / Single Page Web Apps With AngularJS / Assignment 1

Simple AngularJS applications that splits an input string into an array and outputs a message based on the number of words.

The string, a comma separated list of words, is entered in the input field. When the button is pressed, a correpsonding message appears.

The function, splitString, used to split the string is a sophisticated version of string.split(). It can accept multiple options to handle extra spaces, empty strings and duplicate words.

This app trims all extra spaces, ignores empty strings and does not include duplicates in the count.
